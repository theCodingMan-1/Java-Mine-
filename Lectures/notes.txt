OOP is a programming paradigm based on the concept of 'objects'.

C and Java share much of the same syntax.


Attributes:
    - Each object has its own copy of its attributes
    - attributes can be plain datatypes
    - however attributes can be more complex; they may even be references to other objects

Methods:
    - Methods take parameters and return values
    - Can be overloaded (same method name, different parameters)
    - They are the main way to communicate with an object



 == -> checks for equality

 arrays are objects too
