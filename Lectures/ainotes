Don't move within detectives' reach before reveal move
> if node is destination of one of detectives' available moves and your move will be revealed, eliminate node from possible destinations

Use only taxis and secret tickets (if possible)
- BUT if far away from detectives no need use secret?
> if detectives are far away, use taxis
- BUT if only one secret ticket left early in game stage, maybe save it?
> implement a method for calc "value" of a ticket based on number left, how many turns are left, other move options
- ESPECIALLY if just been revealed
- NB: no point using secret if on an only taxi node

Try keep out of detectives reach
- if cannot, use double move

Avoid corners
